Because I wanted to see how github history can be exploited and I was reading [How to Hack GitHub (kind of)](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-hack-github-kind-of-12b08a46d02e). I'm not purposefully doing this to be deceptive, but more just to play and learn how things can be exploited. 

The original hardcoded the `$Y` so I'm using [`date +"%Y"`](https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/Linux/shell/commands/date) to retrieve present year and storing in `$CURRENT` and then using that to set `$START_Y` and `$END_Y`. 

The original also used [brace expansion](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Brace-Expansion) `{..}` to set a range but that proved problematic when trying to access variables. After reading this StackOverflow post, [How do I iterate over a range of numbers defined by variables in Bash?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169511/how-do-i-iterate-over-a-range-of-numbers-defined-by-variables-in-bash), I opted to create a `for loop` using *arithmetic expression* i/o a `for-in loop` allowing me to use dynamic variables:

```bash
CURRENT=$(date +"%Y")
START_Y=$(($CURRENT - 1))
END_Y=$(($CURRENT + 1))

for ((Y=START_Y; Y<=END_Y; Y++))
do
  mkdir $Y
  cd $Y
  ...
done
```

...and then because I like `while loops` more:

```bash
CURRENT=$(date +"%Y")
let Y=$(($CURRENT - 1))
END_Y=$(($CURRENT + 1))

while ((Y<=END_Y))
do
  mkdir $Y
  cd $Y
  ...
  ((Y++))
done
```

** Next up, will need to address `git rm -rf` for removing directories dynamically.

Eventually will have GitHub Octocat running as [gitfiti art](https://github.com/ThuyNT13/gitfiti) soon with the following template because who doesn't want octocat to populate their git history.

```js
:template
[[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,4,4,1,2,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,1,2,1,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],
[4,0,0,4,4,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,3,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4],
[0,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0],
[0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0],
[0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0]]
```

This can take a reeeeeally looooong time as it creates a lot of commits so probably best to run overnight. It's also going to take a while for the commits to be generated to GitHub's commit history.
